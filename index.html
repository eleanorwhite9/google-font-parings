          <h3><span class="font-pair1a">Montserrat</span> + <span class="font-pair1b">Raleway</span></h3>
          <p><b>Perfect combination of two typefaces for reading on web design.</b></p>
          <p>The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.</p>
          <p>Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic was added in 2016.
It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

          <h3><span class="font-pair1a">Playfair</span> + <span class="font-pair1b">Gideon Roman</span></h3>
          <p><b>A good combination of Transitional design and Roman type. </b></p>
          <p>Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms.
            <p>Based on a Roman character set, Gideon is a traditional typeface with classic forms. Perfect for uses from invitations, greeting cards and menus, to display advertising.
The upper case letters have a tradition Roman feel that adds warmth and sophistication to text while the legibility allows for larger blocks of copy to be easily read.
Gideon comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.

          <h3><span class="font-pair1a">Staatliches</span> + <span class="font-pair1b">Cormorant </span></h3>
          <p><b>Bold Bauhaus typeface with a modest secondary Serif.</b></p>
          <p>Staatliches is a clean cut display face with charmingly unconventional proportions. The alphabet was designed in response to Herbert Bayer’s title lettering on the cover of the first Bauhaus exhibition catalogue, which was published in 1923. It features full sets of capitals, numbers, punctuation, and symbols, in addition to alternate widths, discretionary ligatures, and common Latin accents.</p>
          <p>Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.
